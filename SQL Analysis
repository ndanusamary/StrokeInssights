# ðŸ§  Stroke Dataset SQL Analysis

This project performs descriptive, diagnostic, and advanced analysis on a stroke dataset to uncover risk factors and patterns that can inform public health strategies.

-- 2. What is the distribution of gender, age groups, and residence types?
-- Gender Distribution
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM stroke_data
GROUP BY gender;

-- Residence Type Distribution
SELECT Residence_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM stroke_data
GROUP BY Residence_type;

-- Age Group Distribution

SELECT 
    hypertension,
    COUNT(*) AS total,
    SUM(CAST(stroke AS INT)) AS stroke_cases,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CAST(stroke AS INT)) / COUNT(*), 2) AS stroke_rate_percent
FROM stroke_data
GROUP BY hypertension;

-- 8. Compare the average glucose levels and BMI between stroke and non-stroke patients.
SELECT 
    stroke,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_glucose_level), 2) AS avg_glucose,
