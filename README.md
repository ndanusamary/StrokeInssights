# üß† Stroke Analysis Report

This project explores stroke data to identify key patterns and risk factors, and to recommend targeted public health interventions.

## 1. Stroke Cases by Employment Type

People in the private job sector have the highest number of stroke cases (149), followed by the self-employed (65) and those in government jobs (33).

**Recommendation:**
- Private sector organizations should implement wellness initiatives, including regular health screenings, stress management programs, and ergonomic improvements to reduce health risks.
- Self-employed individuals should be targeted with community health outreach, since they may lack structured health benefits.

## 2. Stroke and Smoking Habits

Interestingly, the highest number of stroke cases occurred in individuals who never smoked (90 cases), followed by former smokers (70 cases) and current smokers (42 cases).

**Recommendation:**
- The data underscores the need for continued smoking prevention and cessation support, particularly for ex-smokers who remain at risk.

## 3. Stroke and Hypertension

Stroke cases are more common among individuals without a known history of hypertension (183 cases) compared to those with hypertension (66 cases).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This seems counterintuitive and may suggest a data error or underreporting of hypertension.

**Recommendation:**
- Review and validate data for accuracy ‚Äî especially health condition fields.
- Increase efforts in early detection of hypertension, as it is a major risk factor for stroke. Many individuals may be undiagnosed.

## 4. Stroke Cases by Age Group

Stroke is most prevalent among individuals aged 66 and above (156 cases), followed by those aged 51‚Äì65 (70 cases).

**Recommendation:**
- Strengthen preventive health programs for the elderly, focusing on blood pressure control, healthy diet, exercise, and medication adherence.
- Begin preventive interventions earlier ‚Äî in the 40s and 50s ‚Äî to delay or reduce stroke risk later in life.

## 5. Stroke and Marital Status

Married individuals have a significantly higher number of stroke cases (220) compared to unmarried individuals (29).  
This may be due to age differences, as married individuals tend to be older.

**Recommendation:**
- Promote family-based health education and check-ups.
- Encourage spouses to support each other‚Äôs health goals, including regular medical screenings and stress reduction strategies.

## üìå Conclusion & General Recommendations

This analysis provides key insights into stroke risks across different population groups. To reduce stroke incidence:

- Prioritize early detection of silent risk factors like hypertension.  
- Promote lifestyle changes: physical activity, balanced diets, and smoking cessation.  
- Tailor public health campaigns to target high-risk groups: older adults, private sector employees, and families.
